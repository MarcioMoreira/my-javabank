🧪 JavaBank — Spring MVC Banking Application (Bootcamp Project)

    JavaBank is a backend-focused banking application developed during a Full Stack Java Bootcamp to practice 
    real-world software architecture using Spring and the MVC pattern.

    The project simulates core banking operations while reinforcing best practices in backend development, 
    layered architecture, and clean code.



🧱 Architecture & Design

  JavaBank follows a Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability:

  Model
  Business entities such as accounts, users, and transactions

  Controller
  Handles HTTP requests and orchestrates application flow

  Service
  Encapsulates business logic and validation

  Repository
  Manages data access and persistence

  This structure mirrors enterprise-grade Spring applications and prepares the codebase for scalability.



🚀 Features

  Account creation and management

  Deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations

  Business rule validation (e.g. balance checks)

  Exception handling and error control

  Clear separation between web layer and business logic



🛠️ Tech Stack

  Java

  Spring Framework

  Spring MVC

  Dependency Injection

  Object-Oriented Programming

  Clean Code & SOLID principles



🎓 Learning Outcomes

  Understanding and applying MVC architecture in Spring

  Structuring a backend application using layers

  Writing readable, maintainable Java code

  Handling business logic independently from controllers

  Preparing applications for future integrations (REST APIs, databases, security)



🧠 Bootcamp Mindset

  This project was built with a focus on learning by doing.
  No shortcuts. No magic. Just structure, discipline, and iteration — the path of a developer in training.

  “Architecture matters. Structure brings balance to the code.”
